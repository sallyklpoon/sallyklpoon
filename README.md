### 🌱 Welcome!
* As an upcoming CS grad, I'm looking for new grad opportunities 😼
* I'm currently working on a project for Vancouver YVR and BCIT's Internet of Things to build a dashboard
* I have experience with Python, JS, React, Ruby on Rails, Java, AWS, and TS

🍦 Fun fact: my Chinese name, in Mandarin, sounds like "ice cream"!
